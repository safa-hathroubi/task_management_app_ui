# task_management_UI

An old Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is my first flutter project, and I had fun exploring the different ways I could build the UI of my task management app, which I had designed on Figma after settings down the UML Diagrams for its entities and services.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
